## Known Issues

### 1. Category Update Issue
There is a known API issue with updating categories. When sending the category ID returned from the categories response, the update does not apply to the element as expected. 

> Note: We do not use optimistic updates to avoid showing incorrect data to users. When the data refreshes, the categories will revert to those assigned during element creation.

### 2. Refresh Token
The refresh token functionality is not implemented because the API doesn't provide a way to test it by setting a custom expiration time.

### 3. Price Range Filtering
The API does not handle `price_min` and `price_max` parameters correctly when filtering products. Specifically:
- Values of `0` are treated as undefined and ignored by the API
- Providing only one parameter (either `price_min` or `price_max`) without the other results in no filtering being applied

> Note: A fix has been implemented in `products.ts` â†’ `getProducts()` method that automatically sets missing values (`price_min = 1` or `price_max = 999999`) and removes parameters equal to `0` to ensure proper filtering behavior.
